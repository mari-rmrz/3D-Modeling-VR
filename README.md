# 3D-Modeling-VR
This is meant to be sort of a journal of my journey through 3D Modeling, making a VR game and things I learn along the way

This project was part of a mentorship through Chic Geek's mentorship program in 2018 and will not be updated anymore.
Please check out the wiki to see the journal of my progress.

A video of my final presentation video can be accessed here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15w_LajNGixeISVyDJlGDjmkcOQ9eTYlt/view?usp=sharing
And that concludes my Chic Geek mentorship program experience
